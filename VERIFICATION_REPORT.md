# Verification Report: Package Refactoring

## Summary
All implementations from the main branch have been successfully migrated to the new package structure. No functionality was lost, and all tests are passing.

## Files Migration Status

### ✅ Successfully Migrated Files:

1. **main.go → cmd/devslot/main.go**
   - Main entry point properly moved
   - All commands integrated via Kong CLI framework
   - Clean separation using internal packages

2. **boilerplate.go → internal/command/boilerplate.go**
   - Full functionality preserved
   - Enhanced with better templates and error messages
   - Tests migrated and passing

3. **config.go → internal/config/config.go**
   - LoadConfig → Load (renamed for clarity)
   - FindProjectRoot function preserved
   - Added Repository struct for better data modeling
   - Tests migrated and passing

4. **init.go → internal/command/init.go**
   - All functionality preserved
   - Better modularization using internal packages
   - Tests were missing but now added and passing

5. **lock.go → internal/lock/lock.go**
   - Using main branch's syscall.Flock implementation
   - API changed from Lock/Unlock to Acquire/Release
   - Tests migrated and passing

6. **url.go → internal/git/url.go**
   - ParseRepoURL function preserved
   - Tests migrated and passing

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- All unit tests from main branch have been migrated
- Added missing init_test.go that was deleted from main
- All tests passing: `make test.unit` ✅

### E2E Tests
- E2E tests preserved and enhanced
- Go-based E2E tests added alongside zx tests
- All E2E tests passing: `make test.e2e` ✅

## New Package Structure Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Following golang-standards/project-layout
2. **Cleaner Separation**: Each domain has its own package
3. **Improved Testability**: Easier to test individual components
4. **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new features in appropriate packages

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Checked all deleted files from main were properly migrated
2. ✅ Verified all functionality was preserved
3. ✅ Ensured all tests from main are present and passing
4. ✅ Added missing init_test.go file
5. ✅ Confirmed no tests are being skipped
6. ✅ All make targets working correctly

## Conclusion

The package refactoring has been successfully completed with no loss of functionality. The codebase is now better organized and more maintainable while preserving all existing features and tests from the main branch.
